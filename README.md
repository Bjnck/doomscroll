# Doomscroll
Scroll to the highest level.

>Doomscrolling can be defined as the excessive consumption of vertical, short-form videos for a long period of time, without knowing the amount of time passed.
>
>In the context of doomscrolling, a design feature known as the "infinite scroll" plays a pivotal role in perpetuating this behavior. This feature is a mechanism that allows a social media user to "infinitely scroll", as the software is continuously loading new content and creating an endless stream of information. Consequently, this feature can exacerbate doomscrolling as it removes natural stopping points that a user might pause at.
